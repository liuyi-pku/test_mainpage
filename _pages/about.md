I am a Ph.D student in the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science at Peking University. I am a member of [LANCO](https://lancopku.github.io) group and advised by Prof. [Xu Sun](https://xusun.org). My research interests include natural language processing and machine learning. Recently I am working on federated continual learning problems.
